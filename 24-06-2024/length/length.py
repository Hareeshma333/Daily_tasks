#load the dataset loan_data.csv

# 2.Generate summary statistics for this dataset. What are the mean and standard deviation of the Sepal Length?
summary_stats = df.describe()

#3.Check for any missing values in the dataset. How would you handle them if there were any?

# 4.Convert the species labels to numerical values using a mapping dictionary. For example, map 'FlowerA' to 0, 'FlowerB' to 1, and 'FlowerC' to 2.

# 5 Split the dataset into training and testing sets with 70% training data and 30% testing data. Ensure that the split is stratified based on the species.



# Features and target variable

# Train the decision tree classifier

#7.visualize the trained decision tree.


# Plot the decision tree

#  8.Predict the species for the testing data and compute the accuracy.

# Make predictions on the testing data
y_pred = dt_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Compute the accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

#9.Generate a classification report and a confusion matrix for theÂ predictions.
# Classification report
class_report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=['FlowerA', 'FlowerB', 'FlowerC'])

# Confusion matrix
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
